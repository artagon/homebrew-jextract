# AI Assistant Instructions for homebrew-jextract

## Domain-Specific Skills

This repository uses domain-organized skill files for specialized expertise. AI assistants should reference these files for detailed guidance in each area:

### Core Skills
- **[Homebrew Development](../skills/homebrew.md)** - Formula and cask development, security patterns, validation
- **[GitHub Workflows](../skills/github-workflows.md)** - Actions security, input validation, workflow patterns
- **[Shell Scripting](../skills/shell-scripts.md)** - Bash best practices, error handling, safe patterns
- **[Security Practices](../skills/security.md)** - Input validation, path traversal prevention, cryptographic verification
- **[Development Workflow](../skills/development-workflow.md)** - Git workflows, PR management, code review
- **[Semantic Commits](../skills/semantic-commits.md)** - Conventional commits, changelog generation

## Project-Specific Requirements

### Repository Context
- **Purpose**: Homebrew tap for Jextract Early Access builds
- **Platforms**: macOS (ARM64, x64), Linux (ARM64, x64)
- **Automation**: Daily auto-updates, automated releases, multi-platform CI testing

### Commit Requirements
All commits MUST follow Conventional Commits format. See [semantic-commits.md](../skills/semantic-commits.md) for details.

**Quick Reference:**
```
type(scope): description

Valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci
Valid scopes: cask, formula, workflow, docs, scripts
```

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(cask): add support for Jextract Build 21
fix(formula): correct SHA256 checksum for Linux ARM64
ci(workflow): pin action to commit SHA for security
```

```

### Version Updates

When updating to a new JDK build:

1. **Update version** in both Casks/jextract.rb and Formula/jextract.rb
2. **Download and verify checksums** for all 4 platforms
3. **Validate changes** with brew style and brew audit
4. **Commit** with semantic message: `feat: update to Jextract Build XX`

**Reference Skills:**
- [Homebrew Development](../skills/homebrew.md#version-management)
- [Security Practices](../skills/security.md#cryptographic-verification)
- [Shell Scripting](../skills/shell-scripts.md#network-operations)

### Security Requirements

**Critical Rules:**
- Pin ALL GitHub Actions to commit SHAs → [github-workflows.md](../skills/github-workflows.md#action-pinning)
- Validate ALL external inputs → [security.md](../skills/security.md#input-validation)
- Verify checksums before use → [security.md](../skills/security.md#cryptographic-verification)
- Use realpath for path operations → [homebrew.md](../skills/homebrew.md#path-validation)
- Quote all shell variables → [shell-scripts.md](../skills/shell-scripts.md#safe-command-execution)

### Testing Requirements

**Before Committing:**
```bash
# Syntax validation
ruby -c Casks/jextract.rb
ruby -c Formula/jextract.rb

# Style checking
brew style Casks/jextract.rb Formula/jextract.rb

# Audit
brew audit --cask Casks/jextract.rb
brew audit --formula Formula/jextract.rb
```

**CI Testing:**
- macOS 13, 14 (cask installation)
- Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04 (formula installation)
- Syntax and style validation
- Functional tests (java -version, compile HelloWorld)

### Workflow Patterns

**Feature Development:**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/description

# Make changes with semantic commits
git commit -m "feat(cask): add support for new feature"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feat/description
gh pr create --title "feat: description" --body "..."
```

**Reference:**
- [Development Workflow](../skills/development-workflow.md#feature-branch-workflow)
- [Semantic Commits](../skills/semantic-commits.md#commit-types)

### Automation

**Daily Auto-Updates** (6 AM UTC):
- Scrapes https://jdk.java.net/jextract/ for new builds
- Downloads and verifies checksums
- Creates PR if new build available

**Automated Releases** (on main branch push):
- Validates syntax and style
- Runs multi-platform tests
- Creates GitHub release with changelog

**Reference:**
- [GitHub Workflows](../skills/github-workflows.md#auto-update-workflow)
- [Development Workflow](../skills/development-workflow.md#versioning-and-tagging)

## Quick Reference: Common Tasks

### Task: Add New JDK Build
1. Run `./scripts/update.sh <build-number>` or update manually
2. Verify checksums for all 4 platforms
3. Test: `brew style` and `brew audit`
4. Commit: `feat: update to Jextract Build XX`
5. Push and create PR

**Skills:** [homebrew.md](../skills/homebrew.md), [security.md](../skills/security.md#cryptographic-verification)

### Task: Fix Security Issue
1. Identify vulnerability
2. Create branch: `fix/security-issue-name`
3. Apply fix following security best practices
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Commit: `fix(scope): description` with security note
6. Create PR with security context

**Skills:** [security.md](../skills/security.md), [github-workflows.md](../skills/github-workflows.md)

### Task: Update GitHub Workflow
1. Validate YAML syntax
2. Pin all actions to commit SHAs
3. Validate inputs and add error handling
4. Test in fork if possible
5. Commit: `ci(workflow): description`
6. Monitor workflow runs after merge

**Skills:** [github-workflows.md](../skills/github-workflows.md), [security.md](../skills/security.md#input-validation)

### Task: Write Shell Script
1. Start with strict mode: `set -euo pipefail`
2. Add input validation
3. Implement error handling (trap)
4. Quote all variables
5. Test with ShellCheck
6. Commit: `chore(scripts): description`

**Skills:** [shell-scripts.md](../skills/shell-scripts.md), [security.md](../skills/security.md)

## Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Don't:**
- Skip brew style validation
- Hardcode SHA256 checksums without verification
- Use unpinned GitHub Actions
- Commit without semantic format
- Update README version manually (automated)
- Use rsync in cask postflight (use ditto)

✅ **Do:**
- Run validation before every commit
- Download and verify checksums
- Pin actions to commit SHAs with version comments
- Follow Conventional Commits format
- Let automation handle README updates
- Use ditto (Apple-signed) for file operations

## Emergency Procedures

**If auto-update creates bad PR:**
1. Close the PR
2. Fix issue locally
3. Let auto-update run again next day, or
4. Create manual PR with fix

**If release fails:**
1. Check workflow logs for errors
2. Fix validation/test failures
3. Re-push to main (triggers re-run)

**If CI failing:**
1. Check RuboCop violations
2. Verify SHA256 checksums
3. Test locally when possible
4. Review detailed workflow logs

## Repository Operations

All repository operations should follow the guidelines in:
- [Development Workflow](../skills/development-workflow.md) for Git operations
- [Semantic Commits](../skills/semantic-commits.md) for commit messages
- [GitHub Workflows](../skills/github-workflows.md) for CI/CD changes

## Summary

This repository values:
1. **Security** - Path validation, secure commands, checksum verification
2. **Automation** - Daily updates, automatic releases, comprehensive CI
3. **Quality** - RuboCop enforcement, semantic commits, multi-platform testing
4. **Simplicity** - Clear documentation, skill-based organization
5. **Reliability** - Early detection, rollback capabilities

When in doubt:
- Consult relevant skill file for detailed guidance
- Prioritize security over convenience
- Let automation handle routine tasks
- Follow semantic commit format
- Test before committing
